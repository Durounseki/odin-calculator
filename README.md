## Foundations Final Project: Calculator

This is a simple calculator with graphic interface that looks like and old calculator from the 80's. The name of the calculator is a parody of one of the biggest japanese electronics company.

**The calculator is programmed to do sequential calculation from left to right**. For example the sequence `a` &plus; `b` &times; `c` &equals; , where `a`,`b` and `c` are numbers, evaluates to $(a+b)\times c$, rather than $a+(b\times c)$. I allowed the use of unary operations &plusmn;`a`, `a`&sup2;, &radic;`a`, &percnt;`a`, separating them into prefixing, &plusmn; and &radic;, and postfixing, &percnt; and &sup2;. The evaluation of prefixing operators is done upon input of a binary operation or the 'equals' operator. The evaluation of a postfixing operation is done upon input of that operation.

Since the calculator doesn't use operator precedence, and it includes both type of operators, binary and unary, it is necessary to carefully handle possible different scenarios with unusual input sequences such as 'num1' + 'binary' + 'prefixing' + 'num2' + 'postfixing', which currently evaluates to 'num1' + 'binary' + 'postfixing(prefixing(num2))'.

**There is basic memory capabilities**:

* store or add to memory `M+`, only works when there is no calculation ongoing this prevents sequences such as `a`&plus;`b`&plus;`M+` to add `b` to the memory.
* Recall memory `MR`, displays the number stored in memory only when the current state of the
display is empty.
* Clear memory `MC`, clears the number stored in memory, but do not affect the display.

**There is keyboard support, with the key map**:

* `0` - `9` : '0' - '9'
* &equals; : '='
* &plus; : '+'
* &minus; : '-'
* &times; : '*'
* &divide; : '/'
* &sup2; : 's'
* &radic; : 'r'
* &plusmn; : 'Â±'
* &percnt; : '%'
* &#x232B; : 'backspace'
* `AC` : 'c'
* `M+` : 'm'
* `MR` : 'M'
* `MC` : 'C'

Things to do:

* [x] Remove trailing point on rounded numbers, for example the sequence `10`&radic; &sup2; evaluates to $10.00000$ after truncation and renders as `10.`
* [ ] There are still cases in which numerical errors lead to imprecisions like `3`&radic; &sup2; evaluates to $3.000001$.
* [x] Fix evaluation of square operator. The &sup2; operator is a postfixing operator in contrast to the other unary operators. At the moment the sequence `a`&plus; `b` &sup2; &times; `c` evaluates correctly, but $b^2$ doesn't display before typing &times; or other operator.
* [x] &sup2;`a` displays `0a`.
* [x] Add memory functionalities.
* [x] Change percent operation to unary.
* [ ] Separate script into modules.
* [ ] Write testing module.
* [x] When `ERROR` is displayed and another operation key is typed, the calculation proceeds. For example, if the operation is unitary, then `NAN` is displayed. This should be fixed to abort any calculation and clear the display.
* [x] Division by zero displays 'NAN' instead of 'ERROR'.
* [ ] &plusmn;`a` displays `a`, instead of &plusmn;`a`.
* [x] Handle cases in which display is empty but there is a calculation ongoing.
* [x] Remove empty display.digits if it only contains '-'.
* [x] $\sqrt{C}$ or $\% C$ doesn't work.
* [x] &radic; + &plusmn; `a` + &equals; does not return error.
* [x] &plusmn; + `a` + &radic; does not return error.
* [x] Erase unary when the current is empty and delete key is pressed.
* [x] Change delete to AC if `ERROR` is displayed.
* [x] `a` + &plus; + &plusmn; + &equals; displays `-aa`.
* [x] When display shows '0' and next input is a number, only add a dot.
* [x] When a postfixing operation is evaluated and there is a binary operation ongoing, trying to input a new number removes the current number. I need to change this to reset display and memory.
* [x] Change delete behavior to remove digit from current instead of digits.
